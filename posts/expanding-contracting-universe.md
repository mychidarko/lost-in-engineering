<p>
There are many theories about the universe, but one of the most popular is the expanding universe theory. There is substancial evidence that the universe is expanding, but how is it expanding? What is it expanding into? And what if this is all deceptive and the universe is actually contracting?

Okay, first things first, I'm no astro-physicist, I'm what you'd call a casual with one of those crazy annoying shower thoughts. So, let's get into it.

## Expanding Universe

The expanding universe theory is based on the observation that galaxies are moving away from each other. This observation is supported by the redshift of light from distant galaxies, which indicates that they are moving away from us. The further away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us. This suggests that the universe is expanding. There have been many debates about the nature of this expansion, but you'll usually find stuff along the lines of the big bang set the universe into motion and it's been expanding ever since, dark energy is pushing it, etc.

Funny enough, the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, which is a bit of a head-scratcher. But the explanation you would usually get is that dark energy is responsible for this acceleration. Dark energy is a mysterious force that is thought to make up about 68% of the universe. It is thought to be responsible for the expansion of the universe, but we don't really know much about it. It's like the universe is on a treadmill and someone keeps turning up the speed lol. Okay, I'll stop.

Dark energy has been a topic of much debate and research, but we still don't know much about it. In fact, dark energy itself is a placeholder for our ignorance. Well, it really is a placeholder, let me explain. When scientists observe new systems or phenomena, they often try to explain them using existing theories and models. If these theories and models don't work, they try to look for a specific "item" that would explain the system behaving differently from what they expect. This "item" is called a placeholder. So, dark energy is a placeholder for our ignorance about why the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. This same process was used to discover planets, black holes, and even the Higgs boson... so yeah, it's not a bad thing.

Okay, so the universe is expanding, but what is it expanding into? This is a tricky question because the universe is everything that exists. So, if the universe is expanding, it is expanding into itself. This is a bit of a mind-bender, but it's the best way to think about it. The universe is not expanding into anything because there is nothing outside of the universe. The universe is everything that exists, so there is nothing outside of it. It's like asking what's north of the North Pole. There is no answer because the North Pole is the northernmost point on Earth. Similarly, the universe is everything that exists, so there is nothing outside of it. Anyway, we'll leave that for the philosophers. The real question is what if the universe is actually contracting?

## Contracting Universe

Before you burn me at the stake, hear me out. What if the universe is actually contracting, but we perceive it as expanding? This is a crazy idea, but it's not entirely impossible. And no, I'm not talking about the big crunch theory, which suggests that the universe will eventually stop expanding and start contracting. I'm talking about the idea that the universe is actually contracting right now, but we perceive it as expanding.

Okay, so let's go back to Einstein's theory of general relativity. According to this theory, gravity is the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. We've observed the effects of gravity on the motion of planets, stars, and galaxies, so we know that gravity has a strong influence on the universe. We've seen how back holes can bend light and time, so we know that gravity can have some pretty weird effects. To explain any further, let's go to our "wrong" cloth 2d interpretation of the universe that's been used to explain gravity.

We have a flat plane that represents spacetime. When you place a mass on this plane, it creates a dent in the plane. This dent represents the curvature of spacetime caused by the mass. If you place another mass on the plane, it will roll towards the first mass because of the dent in the plane. This is how gravity works in our 2d universe. Yes, it's a bit of a simplification, but it's a good way to visualize how gravity works.

Now, using this very model, we could make a case for the universe contracting. Imagine that we have a super massive black hole or some kind of body large enough to create a large warp in space-time located somewhere in our theoretical universe. We'll call this body the "great contractor" lol. This great contractor would create a dent in spacetime that would pull everything towards it. Just as with any body in a gravitational field, all the galaxies, stars, and planets in the universe would be pulled towards the great contractor. For this to work, we'll have to assume that nothing in the observable universe has achieved escape velocity from the great contractor which would mean that everything in the universe is being pulled towards the great contractor, causing the universe to contract. Another assumption we need to make is that the great contractor is so massive that and the universe is so large that the effects of the great contractor are not observable at the scale of the observable universe. This would mean that the great contractor is at least X times larger than the observable universe itself. This is a crazy idea, but we're already deep in the rabbit hole, so why not?

Okay now for the fun part. Everything we know is falling towards the great contractor, but we perceive it as expanding. We can back this claim up by looking to popular proven theories like Newton's law of universal gravitation or Einstein's general theory of relativity. Objects fall faster towards the center of gravity the closer they get to it. So, if the universe is contracting, the closer an object is to the great contractor, the faster it would fall towards it. This would explain why we see distant galaxies moving away from us at an accelerating rate. They are falling towards the great contractor, much faster than we are. This would also explain why the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate without the need for dark energy. This "great contractor theory" can be perfectly consistent with our observations we have today. Okay, so what of object on the other side of us? Well, they would be falling towards the great contractor at a slower rate than us, so we would perceive them as moving away from us. This would explain why we see galaxies moving away from us in all directions.

## Wrapping Up

Okay, at this point, I'm just having fun with this idea. I'm not saying that the universe is actually contracting, but it's a fun thought experiment made possible by Einstein's theory of relativity. We perceive motion, time, and space in a certain way, but it's all based on our observations at that point in time. A man in a moving train sees the trees moving backwards, but we know that the trees are actually stationary. Similarly, we see the universe expanding, but it could be contracting. It's all a matter of perspective.

Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this little thought experiment. I'd love to hear what you think. **Hasta luego.**
