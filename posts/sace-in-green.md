<p>
Space is a vast and mysterious place. It is a place where we can explore, learn, and push the boundaries of what is possible and reach for the stars. Humans have always been fascinated by space and have always wanted to explore it which has inspired us to create new technologies, new ideas, and new ways of thinking. Rockets are currently the only way to get to space, and they are an essential part of space exploration, unfortunately, these rockets are notorious for polluting the environment. Can we explore space without harming the environment? Can we explore space in green?

Rockets are amazing feats of engineering, they are large, powerful, and complex machines that zoom through the sky at incredible speeds. Launches are always a sight to behold, with the roar of the engines, the flames, and the smoke, it is a truly awe-inspiring experience. What is not so awe-inspiring is the pollution that a single rocket launch can cause. This pollution is not just limited to the immediate area around the launch site, it can have far-reaching effects on the environment and the climate which can last for years.

This raises up questions about whether governments and private companies truly care about the environment and actually understand the impact that their actions have on the planet. Of course, the first come-back that is usually flung around is that space exploration only accounts for a tiny fraction of the emissions that humans produce, and that is true. However, that does not mean that we should ignore the problem, or that we should not try to find a solution. Rockets directly contribute to climate change in more ways than one, and it is important that we find a way to mitigate their impact.

Before we jump into the solutions, it is important to understand how rockets contribute to climate change. We will talk about the rocket industry as a whole, and not just the launches. Rockets are powered by rocket fuel, which is not always produced in the most environmentally friendly way. Production of rocket fuel releases a significant amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the manufacturing of rockets also produces a significant amount of emissions, as does the disposal of rockets after they have been used. Let's start of with the rising rate of rocket launches.

## The Growth of the Space Industry

The space industry is growing at an incredible rate, with more and more companies and countries getting involved in space exploration. This is a good thing, as it means that we are learning more about the universe and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. However, it also means that the amount of damage caused by the industry produces is also going to increase exponentially. For context, there were a total of 92 rocket launches in 2014, however, 10 years later, just halfway through 2024, there have been 140 launches already.

This growth has been driven by a number of factors, including the increasing demand for satellite launches, the rise of commercial space travel, and the increasing interest in space exploration. This growth is expected to continue in the coming years, with experts predicting that the space industry will be worth over $1 trillion by 2030. This is a huge amount of money, and it is clear that the space industry is only going to get bigger and more powerful in the coming years.

> The space market, for example, has grown to approximately $447 billion—up from $280 billion in 2010—and could grow to $1 trillion by 2030. The number of active satellites—which can handle tasks ranging from tracking data on climate change to processing credit card transactions—could triple within the next decade. - [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/sustainable-inclusive-growth/chart-of-the-day/a-giant-leap-for-the-space-industry)

This growth is not just in terms of valuation, but directly correlates with the number of items we are launching into space, hence the number of launches that are happening. There are significantly more launches today than there were just a few years ago, and this trend is only going to continue. Most of the growth till date can be attributed to SpaceX, which has been leading the charge in the commercial space industry, however, the rest of the industry is catching up. FAST. Companies like Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, and Relativity Space are all making space more accessible and more affordable, while countries like China, India, and the UAE also continue to invest heavily in space exploration. Arianespace, the European Space Agency, and Roscosmos are also making significant contributions to the industry, and are expected to continue to do so in the coming years.

This graph shows the number of launches that have happened each year since 1957. As you can see, the number of launches have been increasing steadily over the years, with a significant increase in the number of launches in recent years. This trend is expected to continue in the coming years, with experts predicting that there will be over 200 launches in 2025, and over 300 launches in 2030.

## Not all rockets are created equal

So far, we have been classifying rockets under one huge umbrella, but it is important to note that not all rockets are created equal. Some rockets are more environmentally friendly than others, and some companies are making more of an effort to reduce their impact on the environment than others. For example, SpaceX has been working on developing reusable rockets, which can significantly reduce the amount of pollution that is produced by each launch. Reusable rockets are a great idea, as they can significantly reduce the cost of launching payloads into space, as well as reduce the environmental footprint since no extra manufacturing would be needed. Besides concepts like this, we also have to consider the type of fuel that is being used. Some fuels are cleaner than others which means that they produce less emissions and are less harmful to the environment, while others are plain nasty. We will try to not lump all rockets together, and instead focus on the ones that are the most harmful to the environment, most flown, or most likely to be replaced in the near future.

## Rocket Fuel

Rockets, just like airplanes and cars generate thrust by burning fuel. To burn the fuel, an oxidizer like oxygen is needed. Airplanes and cars use the oxygen in the air, but since there is no air in space, rockets have to carry their own oxidizer. While this is a liability, it means that rockets can use any combination of fuel and oxidizer that they want. The most common type of rocket fuel is RP-1, which is a refined form of kerosene, and liquid oxygen. RP-1 is a hydrocarbon fuel, which means that it is made up of hydrogen and carbon atoms. There are other popular fuels like liquid hydrogen which was used in the Space Shuttle and is still being used by the SLS, and liquid methane which is used in SpaceX's Starship. Some rockets also use solid rocket fuel, which is a mixture of a fuel and an oxidizer that is solid at room temperature. Solid rocket fuel is less efficient than liquid rocket fuel, but it is cheaper and easier to handle. There are also other types of rocket fuel, such as hypergolic fuels, which ignite on contact with specific oxidizers like nitrogen tetroxide.

Although all of these fuels have their own advantages and disadvantages, they all have one thing in common: their emissions especially high up in the atmosphere can have a significant impact on the environment. Let's take a look at the emissions of some of the most common types of rocket fuel.

![image](https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hydrolox-Emissions.jpg)

Everybody makes the argument that Hydrogen is the cleanest burning fuel, and while that is true, there's a lot more to that equation than meets the eye. While combustion of Hydrogen only produces water vapor and heat, the production of Hydrogen is not so clean. Only 1% of Hydrogen production in the US is done in a green way, and the rest is produced using natural gas, which produces a significant amount of Carbon Dioxide and Carbon Monoxide. We'll talk about this in a bit. Besides production, Hydrogen is also a very light gas, which means that it takes up a lot of space even when liquefied. This means that rockets that use Hydrogen as fuel have to be larger and heavier. For this reason, most Hydrogen rockets require the use of solid rocket boosters to get off the ground. This is not ideal, as solid rocket boosters are not reusable, and they produce a significant amount of pollution.

![image](https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Methalox-Emissions.jpg)

Methane is the wonder child of the rocket industry. It is a hydrocarbon fuel, which means that it is made up of hydrogen and carbon atoms, which makes it denser than Hydrogen, but cleaner burning than RP-1 which is a longer hydrocarbon chain. While methane is a clean burning fuel, it suffers from the same problem as Hydrogen, it is difficult to store and handle. A lot of methane leaks into the atmosphere during production, and while methane is a cleaner burning fuel, it is a very potent greenhouse gas in its raw form.

![image](https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RP-1-Emissions.jpg)

RP-1 is the most commonly used rocket fuel today. It is a long-chain hydrocarbon fuel, which means that it is made up of a long chain of hydrogen and carbon atoms. RP-1 is a good fuel because it is cheap, easy to handle, and has a high energy density, which means that it can produce a lot of thrust for its weight. However, RP-1 is not a clean fuel, as it produces a significant amount of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), soot and other pollutants when it is burned. RP-1 is also a toxic fuel, which means that it is harmful to humans and the environment.

![image](https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SRB-Emissions.jpg)

Solid rocket fuel is another common type of rocket fuel. It is by far the most polluting type of rocket fuel, as they produce a significant amount of soot, oxides of carbon and nitrogen, alumina, chlorine compounds and other pollutants when they are burned. There is not much to say about solid rocket fuel, as the effects of solid rocket fuel on the environment are well known. It is also highly explosive and can be difficult to handle which also posses a significant risk to the environment and the people who work with it.

![image](https://everydayastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hypergolic-Emissions.jpg)

Finally, we have hypergolic fuels. Hypergolic fuels are a type of rocket fuel that ignites on contact with each other. Hypergolic fuels are used in a number of rockets, including the Space Shuttle, and they are known for their simplicity and reliability. However, hypergolic fuels are also highly toxic and corrosive, which means that they are harmful to humans and the environment. They also produce oxides of carbon and nitrogen, and other pollutants when they are burned.

Considering the above, it is clear that rocket fuel is not the cleanest fuel in the world. It is no understatement to say that rocket fuels are probably the most damaging fuels we've seen since Thomas Midgley Jr. invented leaded gasoline. In the case of methane and hydrogen, while the fuel "burns cleanly", the production of these fuels contributes significantly to climate change. Methane is a greenhouse gas that is 25 times more potent than Carbon Dioxide, and Hydrogen is produced using a process called steam methane reforming, which produces a significant amount of Carbon Dioxide. This means that even if rockets are using Hydrogen or Methane as fuel, they are still contributing to climate change, and in more ways than one. We will talk about this in a bit.

## Combustion of Rocket Fuel

We have already talked about some popular types of rocket fuel and their emissions, but we have not talked about how this translates into the real world. For this section, we will focus on the king of modern rocketry, the Falcon 9. The Falcon 9 is a two-stage rocket that is powered by RP-1 and liquid oxygen. The Falcon 9 is one of the most popular rockets in the world, and it is used by SpaceX to launch satellites, cargo, and crew into space. We are focusing on the Falcon 9 because it is the most flown rocket in the world, and it is a good representation of the impact that rockets have on the environment.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7005535-348e-491c-ba74-5f51dd1f0118)

The first stage of Falcon 9 carries approximately 186,000 kg of RP-1 and 312,000 kg of liquid oxygen which is used the propel the rocket up to about 60-70 km (37-43 miles). In addition to the main burn which propels the rocket up into space, the first stage may also perform a re-entry burn, a landing burn and/or boost back burn if necessary. Assuming the RP-1 gets completely used up, we can calculate the amount of Carbon Dioxide that is produced by the Falcon 9. This is math I did not do myself, but I will provide the calculations below.

> Kerosene has a density of about 0.8 g/cm3, so this equates to around 232,508 liters of RP-1.
> The chemical reaction for the combustion of RP-1 with oxygen can be simplified as:
> 2C₁₂H₂₃ + 37 O₂ → 24 CO₂ + 46 H₂O
> Based on this reaction, burning 1 liter of RP-1 produces approximately 3.14 kg of CO2. For the entire first stage burn, this would result in an estimated 730,000 kg (730 metric tons) of CO2 emissions.

This is a significant amount of Carbon Dioxide, and this is just for the first stage of the Falcon 9. We have not even talked about the second stage, or the boosters, or the manufacturing of the rocket, or the disposal of the rocket after it has been used. To put this number into perspective, a Boeing 747 at its maximum takeoff weight of 442,000 kg produces about 160,000 kg of Carbon Dioxide for a 5000 km flight. This means that the first stage of the Falcon 9 produces more than 4 times the amount of Carbon Dioxide that a Boeing 747 produces for a flight that is 10 times shorter. It would take a Boeing 747 about 4 flights of 5000km to produce the same amount of Carbon Dioxide that the Falcon 9 produces in a single launch.

I chose a Boeing 747 because it is probably the most polluting passenger aircraft in the world, and it is a good representation of the impact that airplanes have on the environment.

## Where do rockets pollute?

Rockets and airplanes are the only things that can reach the stratosphere, which is the second layer of the Earth's atmosphere and is directly above the troposphere which we live in. Unlike rockets, commercial airplanes cruise at roughly 13-15 km in altitude. Above this threshold, emissions tend to stick around for years instead of the few weeks they usually take to dissipate, which is dangerous because emissions like soot and water vapor around this altitude display extremely potent greenhouse effects. This is another reason why even though Hydrogen and Methane are clean burning fuels, they are not as clean as they seem. They produce water vapour, which has potent greenhouse effects in the upper atmosphere. It traps heat and contribute to global warming just as well as soot, alumina and Carbon Dioxide.

There is an amazing visualization by [CBC](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/features/2023/rocket-pollution/) that shows different levels of pollution at different altitudes.

The exhaust from these rockets can also directly react with the ozone in the upper stratosphere which could lead to "holes" in the ozone layer. This is a big problem, as the ozone layer protects us from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun, and a hole in the ozone layer could have serious consequences for the environment and the climate. There have been considerable efforts to recover stratospheric ozone since the late '80s, and now frequent rocket exhaust reacting with this ozone could undo all the work global communities have put into Ozone recovery.

I personally don't think rockets get enough credit for their effects on climate change since carbon emissions are just a small part of the damage a rocket can actually do. We are so worried about our Carbon Footprint that we forget that there are other things that can have a significant impact on the environment. The effects of rockets on the ozone layer are usually disregard by scientists who generally say something along the lines of: "We don't understand the effects of emissions so high in the atmosphere.".

Besides the emissions and the effects on the ozone layer, failed launches can also have a significant impact on the environment. Rockets are not always successful, and when they fail, they can release a significant amount of toxic and hazardous materials into the environment. They may even fall out of the sky and crash into the ground, sometimes near populated areas. NASA, the FAA and other international space agencies have strict guidelines on where rockets can be launched from, and where they can land, however, accidents do happen, and when they do, they can have serious consequences for the environment and the people who live near the launch site.

## Rocket end-of-life

A lot of rockets have been launched into space since the dawn of the space age, and most of them get thrown into the ocean at the end of their life. This is a big problem, as rockets are not designed to be disposed of in an environmentally friendly way. Rockets are made up of a number of toxic and hazardous materials, including rocket fuel, oxidizers, and other chemicals, which can have serious consequences for the environment if they are not disposed of properly.

Some rockets are designed to burn up in the atmosphere, while others are designed to crash into the ocean, and others are designed to be recovered and reused.

According to credible sources like the European Space Agency (ESA), atmospheric re-entry may have possible long-term consequences on the Ozone layer. Let's say that is just an unfounded possibility, we still have parts of rockets being dumped into oceans. These rocket parts may contain residual fuel that will probably hurt marine life in the vicinity. Companies like SpaceX are solving this particular problem by landing their rockets on drone ships and landing sites, however, even the Falcon 9 is not 100% re-usable and has parts that are discarded into the ocean. Starship promises to fix this issue, and from the tests that have been carried on so far, that looks like a real-possibility. Though these very tests had parts discarded into the Indian Ocean. The good news is that methane won't harm marine life.

## Space Debris

Space debris is a huge problem plaguing the space industry at the moment, and is only getting worse. Space debris is made up of defunct satellites, spent rocket stages, and other debris that is orbiting the Earth. There are currently over 20,000 pieces of space debris that are being tracked by the US Space Surveillance Network, and there are estimated to be over 100 million pieces of space debris that are too small to be tracked. This space debris poses a serious threat to satellites, spacecraft, and astronauts in space, but also poses a serious threat to the environment on Earth.

Not all space debris burns up in the atmosphere, and some of it can survive re-entry and crash into the Earth. This space debris can contain toxic and hazardous materials, including rocket fuel, oxidizers, and other chemicals, which can even react with the ozone layer and other stratospheric gases.

Repeated issues with large chunks of debris from Dragon — "trunks" where the fuel and electrical supplies are held — have repeatedly crashed down in areas ranging from Australia to North Carolina. And this is just SpaceX. Other companies have had similar issues, and it is only a matter of time before a large piece of space debris causes serious damage to property or even loss of life.

## The industry and Climate change

According to the numbers, the space industry is responsible for an insignificant amount of CO₂ emissions. However as we have seen, the emissions from rockets are not just CO₂, they are also soot, water vapor, and other pollutants that can have even more serious consequences for the environment and the climate.

The space industry is growing at an incredible rate, and it is clear that the consequences of this growth are not being taken into account. The space industry is a powerful industry that is driven by profit, and most companies and countries are more interested in making money than they are in protecting the environment.

The effects of global warming have been hitting us fast and furious over the last few years, from people losing their homes to a complete change in weather patterns and more turbulent weather, we are gradually getting to a point of a permanent damage. That's a story for a different article though. I am no climate activist, however, it is obvious that the entire aerospace industry (both space and aviation) needs to do better in order to preserve the environment.

This is becoming more of a priority since we currently have no way of removing emissions that have already been spewed into the atmosphere. Carbon capture and other methods are only useful for a handful of industries, and they are not a solution to the problem. That being said, what can we do to make space exploration more environmentally friendly?

## The solutions?

There is no real way to make space travel and exploration completely green, however, there are a number of things that we can do to reduce the impact that rockets have on the environment. For starters, we can cut down on the use of solid rocket fuel, which is by far the most polluting type of rocket fuel. While being cleaner fuels, the production of Hydrogen and Methane is not clean, which beats the purpose of using them in the first place. A solution in that regard would be to invest in cleaner ways of producing Hydrogen and Methane, or to use other types of fuels that are less harmful to the environment. While this would still place water vapor in the upper atmosphere, it would be a step in the right direction.
Once again, there is no real solution when it comes to fuels because all of them have their own advantages and disadvantages. Hydrogen and methane are cleaner but require a large infrastructure to safely handle and store, RP-1 is cheap and easy to handle but is very polluting. We can however, invest in cleaner ways of producing these fuels, minimize the use of solid rocket fuel, and only use hypergolic fuels when absolutely necessary like in reaction control systems which function in space.

There have been proposals for nuclear-thermal reactors, but there is barely any public information on the effects this new propulsion system will have on our environment. Electric rockets might not make an appearance this century, so technically, a new propulsion system may not be the answer to our problem. Maybe building rockets in a more efficient way so as to cut down on the total propellant used, or investing in reusable rockets would be a better solution.

Reusable rockets can significantly reduce the amount of pollution that is produced by each launch. Reusing rockets would mean less manufacturing, less waste, and less pollution in general since the rockets are not discarded after every use. It would be a win-win for everyone. Companies like SpaceX are already working on developing a fully reusable rocket (Starship), and other companies have also started looking into this technology.

Space-planes might also help in reducing the overall emissions of every mission since unlike traditional rockets, space-planes can take off and land like airplanes and also benefit from lift which reduces the amount of fuel needed to reach orbit. Space-planes are not a new concept, but they have not been widely adopted due to the complexity of the technology. However, with advancements in materials science and engineering, it is possible that space-planes could become a reality in the near future.

While these are all good ideas, the most important thing that the space industry can do is invest in research and development of new technologies that can re-capture emissions that have already been spewed into the atmosphere. Even is every industry in the world stopped emitting CO₂ and other pollutants today, we would still have a significant amount of emissions in the atmosphere that would continue to have an impact on the environment and the climate. We need to find a way to remove these emissions or transform them into something that is less harmful to the environment. If this part of the problem is solved, then it would not matter how much emissions we produce, as we would be able to remove them from the atmosphere. At that point, we would truly be able to explore space in green.

## Conclusion

Space exploration is an amazing thing, and it is something that we should continue to do. However, it is important that we do it in a way that is sustainable and environmentally friendly. We should not destroy our home planet in our quest to explore other planets. We should not pollute the environment in our quest to learn more about the universe. We should not harm the climate in our quest to reach for the stars. We should explore space in green, and we should do it now!
